// step 1 - Fetch the questions: read through the jService API there is no API key associated with jService. The questions for each game will come from a single, randomly determined category, meaning each game and its questions will focus on one category (ex: "Australia"). One way (not the required way) 

// to do this is to use GET /api/random to get a category's ID from a random question to use as a query parameter for GET /api/clues, which gives 100 questions in a particular category.

// should build a function to use math.random() to help the categories and questions be random. 

// step 2- presenting the questions
// make a button that triggers the start of the game and the first random question no using alerts or prompts.

// step 3 respond  
// make a box users can see the category and question in and another box for the answer. The answer the user writes should be a string even if there are numbers. still can't use alerts or prompts

// step 4 was the answer right?
// capitalizations shouldn't count only spelling. every correct answer gets +1 point and every incorrect answer ends the game and resets it. if statements to determine when the game should reset and when there should be points added. also show a message if the answer is right or not like a game over thing. 

// step 5- score
// create something to keep score with and display it somewhere on screen.
